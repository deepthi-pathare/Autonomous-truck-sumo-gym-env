# Tactical decision making for Autonomous Truck in SUMO using Reinforcement Learning
A gym package for tactical decision making of autonomous truck in highway environment with SUMO.

The repository includes three versions of the environment:
1. sumo_gym_baseline_architecture: Baseline architecture where the truck is controlled by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent
2. sumo_gym_new_architecture: New architecture which integrates RL with low level longitudinal and lateral controllers, 
3. sumo_gym_new_architecture_tcop: New architecture by incorporating total cost of operation (TCOP) of the truck into the RL reward function. 

For more details of the environment and the architectures, please refer the paper [Improved Tactical Decision Making and Control Architecture for
Autonomous Truck in SUMO Using Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10386803)
