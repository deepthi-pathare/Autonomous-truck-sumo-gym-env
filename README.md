# Autonomous-truck-sumo-gym-env
A gym package for tactical decision making of autonomous truck in highway environment using SUMO.

The repository includes three versions of the environment:
1. sumo_gym_baseline_architecture: Baseline architecture where the truck is controlled by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent
2. sumo_gym_new_architecture: New architecture which integrates RL with low level longitudinal and lateral controllers, 
3. sumo_gym_new_architecture_tcop: New architecture by incorporating total cost of operation (TCOP) of the truck into the RL reward function. 

For more details of the environment and the architectures, please refer the paper "Improved Tactical Decision Making and Control Architecture for
Autonomous Truck in SUMO Using Reinforcement Learning".
